# Competitive Programming

Competitive programming is fun :)

I've competed in several algorithmic programming competitions over the past few years; below are a few of the major ones:

* USA Computing Olympiad (USACO)
* Facebook Hacker Cup
* Google CodeJam/KickStart
* ACM Intercollegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)
* 15-295 (CMU's Competitive Programming Class/Club)

Here are my solutions to problems from several of them (as well as a few templates I use), all are in C++.
